## Quantum-behaved PSO with Chaotic Operators for Resource Constrained Project Scheduling

### [Original Paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0957417422004456)

The paper addresses the multi-objective resource-constrained project scheduling problems with stochastic activity durations and alternative execution methods. A hybrid approach that integrates sample average approximation (SAA) and an improved multi-objective chaotic quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (MOCQPSO) algorithm is proposed. This repository contains the codes of the proposed algorithm and case study design.
